# Recurrent Google Tasks

Simple implementation of recurrent/repeating tasks for Google Tasks.

## How to "install"
1. create Google Apps script in your Google Drive
2. copy content of code.gs into newly created script
3. save it (it should yell no errors :-)
4. create time based trigger for this script (1-2x per day should be enough)
5. this should be it

## Initial configuration
1. script expects that task list having title "Recurrent" does exist, so create one or rename existing on
2. 

## Requirements
This simple script is using existing Google Tasks API and does not require any special apps or services to be installed or used.
